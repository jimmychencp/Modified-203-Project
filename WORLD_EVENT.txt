To trigger the event you mouse left click on any locations in the world, it will spawn a portal and the proximity of
the click location. At the same time a priest will spawn on the bottom left corner of the world. When the event is
triggered, any fairies in the proximity of the portal will become corrupted and turns in to an evil fairy. The evil
fairies, tired of replanting trees over and over again seeks to hunt down all the dudes who kept cutting tree. The priest,
who spawns along with the portal will seek any corrputed fairies and chase them down in the attempt to purify them back
to normal fairies. The 32x32 versions of the images are way too small so I kept them at original scales.
